        The term "drone" dates back to the early days of aviation, when it was
        applied to remotely-flown target aircraft like the 1920s Fairey Queen
        and 1930s de Havilland Queen Bee that were used to train firing
        battleship guns. The Airspeed Queen Wasp and Miles Queen Martinet were
        later models, before being eventually replaced by the GAF Jindivik. The
        word is still widely used.
